    "body": "Hi team, I've reviewed the Project Phoenix proposal and have some initial thoughts. The technical approach looks solid, but I'm concerned about the timeline. The Q2 deadline seems aggressive given the scope. We should consider breaking this into phases. The budget allocation also needs review - the infrastructure costs seem underestimated. Overall, the concept is strong and aligns with our strategic goals. Let's schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss the feedback in detail."
