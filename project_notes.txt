BLUE OCEAN
==========
Status: MVP Development Phase  
Timeline: 8 weeks for core features, +4 weeks for mobile
Budget: On track

Key Points:
- Customer validation strong: 80% interest rate from interviews
- Mobile-first experience is non-negotiable requirement
- Competitive analysis shows differentiation through simplicity
- Partnership opportunities with 3 major platform providers

Technical Notes:
- Microservices architecture: 5 core services with API gateway
- Technical debt assessment shows manageable levels
- 3 areas need refactoring: auth module, data pipeline, API layer
- Test coverage at 85%, could improve in core modules

MVP Feature Priority:
1. Core workflow automation (must-have)
2. Mobile app (high priority)
3. Real-time notifications (high priority)  
4. Basic reporting (medium)
5. Advanced analytics (nice-to-have)

Customer Insights:
- Users want mobile-first experience
- Real-time notifications critical
- Pricing model resonates but want flexible payment options
- Integration capabilities are key differentiator

Partnership Strategy:
- Platform integrations offer highest impact
- Revenue sharing models need definition
- API robustness critical for partner success
- 2 consulting firms interested in implementation partnerships

CROSS-PROJECT CONSIDERATIONS
